The emerging multi-disciplinary field of biomedical optics uses light and other forms of radiant energy to image, analyze and manipulate living tissue at cellular and molecular levels, in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner. The enormous potential of this technology to promote human and animal health is being pursued by a rapidly growing industry, focused on translating scientific discoveries around lasers, light and imaging into useful medical tools.</p>

The target deliverables at project completion are prototype devices, instruments, and data demonstrating proof of principle of the application of fibre-optic based tissue characterization and Seno&rsquo;s globally patented optoacoustic diagnostic imaging technology to monitoring of thermal cancer therapy. The research may result in the integration of these two leading-edge technologies into a groundbreaking new cancer treatment modality, with potential for further applications to small animal research, ischemic stroke, and development of nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals.</div>
