<p>On a molecular scale, recent advances in Raman spectroscopy have been substantial, especially given the developments in CCD and photomultiplier (PMT) detection technologies. Raman spectroscopy probes the vibrational energy levels of molecules via inelastic optical scattering. Signals are much weaker than autofluorescence and hence high efficiency detection systems are required.</p>

<div>Raman peaks are sensitive to tissue molecules and thus this method represents a powerful tool for tissue diagnosis, including optical biopsy applications. Choice of excitation wavelength depends on the application. Near-infrared excitation provides for the needed maximal penetration in tissues. However, determining the optimal wavelength is a trade-off between minimizing background autoflourescence (at higher NIR wavelength, i.e. 1064 nm) and maximizing Raman signal (at lower NIR 47 wavelength, i.e. 785 nm). Furthermore, the sensitivity of available detectors above 1 &micro;m is limited. As a result, 785 nm appears to be a good choice.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Raman spectra of thermally damaged tissues will be studied. It is anticipated that the Raman shift in collagen rich tissues, such as muscle, would be sensitive to the conformational changes in tissue proteins that occur during the coagulation process. Although there are limited published data that demonstrate the effects of temperature on Raman spectra of collagen in vitro, there appear to be no such studies in tissues.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Investigations in a number of ex vivo tissues including muscle, liver, kidney and prostate will be initiated to identify relevant Raman peaks and refine the technique before in vivo experimentation in rodent liver and canine prostate models. Novel Raman detection probes will be designed and fabricated, first for surface measurements, and then for interstitial applications. This new application of Raman spectroscopy will advance our understanding of the structural, compositional and molecular characteristics of normal and diseased tissues (i.e. optical biopsy) and how detected changes can enable novel approaches for guiding laser therapies.</div>
