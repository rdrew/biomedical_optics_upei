<div><em>&ldquo;</em><em>The primary focus of my research is on the emerging area of optoacoustics. This non</em><em>-in</em><em>vasive, new area of research, allows for three-dimensional imaging of objects using lasers and integration o</em><em>f reflected sound waves. Currently, my research is focused on the development of emerging technolo</em><em>gies for the biomedical science sector including novel methods for disease detection and cancer management. Howev</em><em>er, the technology may find wider application in the material science and life science sectors. Specifically, we are investigating the potential of interstitial thermal therapy as an effective modality for the treatment of disease, including the thermal destruction of small solid tumors. We are currently focusing our efforts on the treatment of prostate cancer. However, the general goal of this work is to optimize and control interstitial thermal therapy for a variety of tissue pathologies.&rdquo;</em></div>
