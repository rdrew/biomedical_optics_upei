		<p><span>The <strong>Biomedical Optics Project</strong> consists of three research foci:<span><img height="338" width="450" align="right" alt="" src="/biomedical-optics/sites/discoveryspace.upei.ca.biomedical-optics/files/DSC00155.JPG" /></span></span></p>
		<div><span>&bull; design, develop and fabricate an optical fiber platform that will enable the effective delivery and assessment of laser thermal therapies.</span></div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div><span>&bull; develop new fiber optic instruments that are sensitive to changes in tissue structure and hemodynamics for improved tissue characterization.</span></div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div><span>&bull; develop new functionality to Seno Medical&rsquo;s optoacoustic platform for cancer therapy guidance and assessment, and with this new knowledge, work to develop a next generation optoacoustic system capable of large animal and human imaging in a clinical setting.</span></div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<p><span>The project will be carried out over a five-year period. The project will be based at UPEI in Charlottetown, PEI. The initial prototyping work will be carried out at UPEI, and further development of prototypes will be carried out in partner facilities in Slemon Park and San Antonio, Texas. As technologies are developed they will be first tested and validated through pre-human clinical trials conducted at UPEI&rsquo;s Atlantic Veterinary College, and then used in human clinical trials carried out at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. </span></p>
